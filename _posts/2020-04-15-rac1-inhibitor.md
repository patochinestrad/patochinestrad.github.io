In this work, I contributed to the analysis and characterization of over 50 conformations
of the Rac1 protein. For that, Z-score of the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) was analysed. Furthermore, 
I performed docking experiments to evaluate the impact of a point mutation on the interaction of Rac1 and CDC42 (a highly similar protein)
with 1A-116, a drug developed at the Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, UNQ.
