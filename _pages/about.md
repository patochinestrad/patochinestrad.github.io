I'm a PhD student at the Molecular Pharmacology Laboratory of the National University of Quilmes.
A biology heavy background combined with my reasearch at the Molecular Pharmacology Lab gives me knowledge
and experience in both _in vitro_ and _in silico_ techniques for rational drug design. 

Usually, my work involves generating, processing and analyzing large amounts of data, for which I use
Python and in some special cases, Nim. My programming skills are centered around Data Science, Anlytics
and Visualization.
